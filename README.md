## Inspiration
Growing up in Africa, I witnessed firsthand the educational challenges faced by many students and teachers. This project is my contribution towards bridging that gap.

## Technical Details
The E-Learning Africa platform uses the following technologies:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and efficient page loads.
- **Prisma**: For managing the MySQL database through Planetscale.
- **Stripe**: For secure payment processing.
- **Clerk**: For user authentication and management.

### Key Features
1. **Browse & Filter Courses**: Easily find courses using filters.
2. **Purchase Courses using Stripe**: Secure and seamless payment integration.
3. **Teacher Mode**: Instructors can manage courses and track student progress.

### Most Difficult Technical Challenge
Integrating video processing using Mux was particularly challenging. I had to optimize video encoding parameters and server configurations to improve processing time and playback quality.

### Learnings
- **Technical**: Optimized video processing and efficient API integration.
- **Personal Growth**: Learned the importance of resilience and collaboration.
- **Future Path**: Committed to developing more educational technology solutions.
